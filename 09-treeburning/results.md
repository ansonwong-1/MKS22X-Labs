#### 1. Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?
I chose it because 100 is a number I like. Also, I thought it would be big enough for the time to be consistent and have a greater difference between the densities and when I ran it, it wasn't that slow.
#### 2. Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?
I chose it because I thought there should be more repetitions in order to get a more accurate average.
#### 3. What did your testing show about changing the board size?
My testing showed that changing the board size resulted in similar times for the first few densities but as the size got larger so did the time. It also took more time to run the bigger the size got.
#### 4. Knowing that there were differences based on board size, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?
The maximum burn time goes up with the board size. I tested this by using a for loop of different squared board sizes and increasing the width and height by 100 until 1000 and printed the maximum burn time for each.
#### 5. What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?
0.615
